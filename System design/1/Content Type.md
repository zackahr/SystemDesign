Content-Type is a header field in an HTTP request or response that indicates the media type of the resource being sent or received. It specifies the format of the data contained in the HTTP message body, allowing the recipient to interpret and handle the content appropriately. Content-Type is essential for ensuring proper rendering, processing, and interpretation of web content by browsers and other HTTP clients.

The Content-Type header consists of a MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) type followed by an optional character encoding. The MIME type specifies the general category of the content, such as text, image, audio, video, application, etc.

Here are some common MIME types and their corresponding categories:

1. **text/plain:** Plain text content without any specific formatting.
2. **text/html:** Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) content used for web pages.
3. **text/css:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) content used for styling HTML documents.
4. **application/json:** JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) content used for data interchange.
5. **application/xml:** Extensible Markup Language (XML) content used for data representation.
6. **image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif:** Image content in different formats.
7. **audio/mpeg, audio/wav:** Audio content in different formats.
8. **video/mp4, video/quicktime:** Video content in different formats.
9. **application/pdf:** Portable Document Format (PDF) content.
