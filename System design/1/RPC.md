***Definition***

#RPC Network calls, often referred to as Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), are a mechanism used in distributed computing environments to allow one computer program to execute code in another address space (commonly on another machine) as if it were a local procedure call.

#RPC is commonly used in various distributed computing scenarios such as client-server applications, microservices architectures, and cloud computing environments to facilitate communication between different components or services across a network. It abstracts away the complexities of network communication, allowing developers to focus on building distributed systems without worrying about low-level networking details.

Creating an #RPC (Remote Procedure Call) system involves several steps, and there are various ways to implement it depending on your requirements and the technologies you're using.

***Define Remote Procedures:***

- Identify the procedures or functions that you want to make accessible remotely.
- Define the parameters and return types for each remote procedure.

***Choose a Communication Protocol:***

- Select a communication protocol for transmitting remote procedure calls and data between client and server.
- Common choices include [[HTTP]], [[TCP/IP]], [[UDP]], or custom protocols.

***Choose a Serialization Format:***

- Decide on a serialization format for converting data into a format that can be transmitted over the chosen communication protocol.
- Popular serialization formats include JSON, XML, [[Protocol Buffers]], or [[MessagePack]].

***Implement Client and Server Components:***

- Write code to implement the client-side component that will initiate remote procedure calls.
- Write code to implement the server-side component that will receive remote procedure calls, execute the requested procedures, and return results.

***Marshalling and Unmarshalling:***

- Implement logic for marshalling (serialization) and unmarshalling (deserialization) parameters and return values before and after transmitting them over the network.
- Ensure that data is properly encoded and decoded according to the chosen serialization format.

***Handle Errors and Exceptions:***

- Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with network errors, timeouts, and exceptions that may occur during remote procedure calls.
- Define how errors and exceptions are communicated between the client and server.

***Security Considerations:***

- Implement security measures such as authentication, encryption, and access control to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- Consider potential security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks and implement countermeasures accordingly.

***Testing and Debugging:***

- Test the RPC system thoroughly to ensure that remote procedure calls work as expected under various conditions.
- Debug any issues that arise during testing and refine the implementation as needed.

***Documentation and Maintenance:***

- Document the RPC system, including the available remote procedures, their parameters, and usage guidelines.
- Maintain the RPC system by addressing any bugs, adding new features, and keeping it up-to-date with changes in requirements or technologies.
