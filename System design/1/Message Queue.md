Think of a message queue like a to-do list for computer programs. Just like how you write down tasks you need to do, programs use message queues to keep track of things they need to do or messages they need to process.

Here's why they create message queues in a simple way:

**1 - Organization**:

It helps programs stay organized by keeping track of tasks or messages in a list.

**2 - Efficiency**: 

Programs can keep working on other things while waiting for tasks to be completed or messages to arrive.

**3 - Flexibility**:

Message queues allow different parts of a program or different programs to communicate without needing to be directly connected. It's like leaving notes for someone else to pick up later.

**4 - Reliability**: 

If something goes wrong, messages in the queue are usually safe until they can be processed, preventing important information from getting lost.
